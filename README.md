# Sumo Robot based on Arduino Uno 

## Team members: Toktokozhoev Urmat, Akylbekova Rozalina

This project is dedicated to creating a Sumo Robot based on Arduino Uno. The robot can rotate in place, detect a target using an ultrasonic sensor, approach it, and lift it with a servo motor. The robot is designed for competitions and educational purposes.

   - Mount the motor shield onto the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the digital pins of the Arduino:
     * VCC - Analog 2
     * Trig - Analog 3
     * Echo - Analog 4
     * GND - Analog 5
   - Attach the servo motor to the designated pin on the motor shield (Ser1).
     * GND - -
     * VCC - +
     * Control - S
   - Power the setup using the battery holders and batteries.

## Code Overview

1. States:
Stop.
Rotate right/left to search for a target.
Move forward towards a detected target.
Lift the target using a servo motor.

2. Ultrasonic Sensor:
Measures distance to objects.
Triggers state changes based on proximity to the target.

3. Motors:
Control movement and turning.
Functions: moveForward(), turnRight(), turnLeft(), stopMotors().

4. Servo Motor:
Activates to lift the target when itâ€™s within the defined range.

The robot continuously checks distance every 50ms and switches behavior autonomously to find and interact with targets.

## Conclusion

In this project, we built a robot that demonstrates the basic principles of working with Arduino and peripherals such as ultrasonic sensors and servo motors. We learned:

- How to construct mechanisms using 3D printing. The robot was assembled entirely without glue, using bolts for all connections.
- How to connect and program motors and sensors.
- How to develop algorithms for autonomous robot control.

This project helps develop skills in robotics, programming, and engineering design, and provides an excellent foundation for more complex projects.
